This application is called RecipeMust. 
RecipeMust was created with the purpose of providing recipes and nutrition facts for the user to find their desired recipe or learn about their ingredients nutrition facts.


How to utilize RecipeMust:
Once the user sucessfully signs in, they are able to access a variety of recipes and nutrient facts. When user wants to search a recipe they can search an ingredient and recipes that use that ingredient will pop-up. Once user is interested in a certain recipe they are able to first view the ingredients by clicking the "See Ingreients" button and once they are ready to see the instructions they can click the "Get Recipe" button which will open up a new tab of the recipe's website. In the Nutrition Facts page the user can type in an ingredient to find out that ingredients carbohydrates, fat, fiber, and protein.
In this project was created using Reactjs and two different API's.

User must login in order to access recipes and nutrition facts.

I have created an ingredient button so that the user will be able to view the ingredients before deciding whether or not they would like to use that recipe.

Few things I would like to incorporate in the near future: Logout feature, conditionally render the "See Ingredient" button, and make my searching all horizontal.
