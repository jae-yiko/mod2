This application is called RecipeMust. 
RecipeMust was created with the purpose of providing recipes and nutrition facts for the user to find their desired recipe or learn about their ingredients nutrition facts. In this project was created using Reactjs, route, hooks, component state and two different API's.

User must login in order to access recipes and nutrition facts.

Once the user sucessfully signs in, they are able to search recipes within the home page

I have created an ingredient button so that the user will be able to view the ingredients before deciding whether or not they would like to use that recipe.

Within the nutition page, users are able to search the nutrition facts such as carbohydrates, fat, fiber, and protein of any ingredient.

Few things I would like to incorporate in the near future: Redux, Logout feature, conditionally render the "See Ingredient" button, and make my searching all horizontal.
